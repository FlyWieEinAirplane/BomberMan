# BomberMan
classic multiplayer game Bomberman written in Java with Remote Method Invocation (RMI) and Processing for UI

The project is split into server and client while 4 clients can play on 1 server.
To start just run MainServer and MainClient.

Settings in GameClient:
  Every Client must choose a playername which has to be unique for the server.
  (When starting more than one client on one computer the ownPort has to differ)
